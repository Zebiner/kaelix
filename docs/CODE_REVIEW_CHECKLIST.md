# MemoryStreamer Code Review Checklist

## Performance Review Criteria

### Zero-Copy and Memory Management
- [ ] Verify no unnecessary memory allocations
- [ ] Check for use of `bytes::Bytes` for message payloads
- [ ] Ensure reference counting instead of cloning
- [ ] Validate use of memory-mapped files where appropriate
- [ ] Review arena allocation for batch processing
- [ ] Check object pool usage for frequently allocated objects

### Lock-Free Patterns
- [ ] Verify preference for lock-free data structures
- [ ] Check usage of `crossbeam` data structures
- [ ] Minimize use of `std::sync::Mutex` and `Arc<RwLock<T>>`
- [ ] Validate lock contention mitigation strategies
- [ ] Review critical sections for potential lock-free refactoring

## Security Review Requirements

### Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Verify JWT/OAuth 2.0/SASL implementation
- [ ] Check hierarchical ACL enforcement
- [ ] Validate authorization decision caching
- [ ] Review security overhead (<0.1% throughput impact)
- [ ] Ensure constant-time comparison for secrets

### Input Validation
- [ ] Check comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Verify no potential injection points
- [ ] Review error handling for information leakage
- [ ] Validate configuration parameter sanitization

### Encryption and Network Security
- [ ] Verify mTLS implementation
- [ ] Check encryption key management
- [ ] Review network protocol security
- [ ] Validate secure token/credential handling

## Testing Validation Points

### Unit Testing
- [ ] 95%+ code coverage
- [ ] Property-based tests for critical invariants
- [ ] Deterministic testing for distributed components
- [ ] Edge case and failure path coverage
- [ ] Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Network failure simulation
- [ ] Cluster state transition testing
- [ ] Security boundary validation
- [ ] Performance regression tests
- [ ] Chaos engineering scenarios

## Code Quality Standards

### Rust Best Practices
- [ ] Use of `#[inline]` for hot path functions
- [ ] SIMD optimization where beneficial
- [ ] Effective use of async/await
- [ ] Proper error handling with `thiserror`/`anyhow`
- [ ] Meaningful type definitions
- [ ] Clear, self-documenting code

### Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Adherence to zero-copy principles
- [ ] Consistent batching of operations
- [ ] Proper backpressure mechanisms
- [ ] Minimal blocking in async contexts
- [ ] Component separation and responsibility
- [ ] Performance target alignment

## MemoryStreamer-Specific Requirements

### Throughput and Latency
- [ ] Verify 10M+ messages/second capability
- [ ] Confirm <10Î¼s latency (P99)
- [ ] Check partition and topic scalability
- [ ] Review message routing efficiency

### Consensus and Availability
- [ ] Validate Raft consensus implementation
- [ ] Check Multi-Raft partition handling
- [ ] Verify automatic failover (<500ms)
- [ ] Review leader election mechanisms

### Observability and Monitoring
- [ ] Comprehensive logging
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] Distributed tracing support
- [ ] Error reporting mechanisms

## Review Workflow

1. Automated Pre-Review Checks
   - Clippy linting passed
   - rustfmt formatting compliant
   - All tests passing
   - Performance benchmarks stable

2. Reviewer Checklist Walkthrough
   - Methodically go through each section
   - Request changes for any non-compliance
   - Provide constructive feedback
   - Verify security and performance implications

3. Performance Impact Assessment
   - Quantify any performance regressions
   - Compare against baseline metrics
   - Discuss optimization strategies

## Sign-Off Criteria

A code review is considered complete and approved when:
- All checklist items are satisfactorily addressed
- No critical or high-severity issues remain
- Performance and security targets are met
- Tests demonstrate expected behavior
- Code maintains project's architectural integrity
