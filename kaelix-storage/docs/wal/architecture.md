# WAL System Architecture

## Component Overview

The Write-Ahead Log (WAL) system is composed of several sophisticated components that work together to provide high-performance, reliable logging:

### 1. SegmentWriter
- Responsible for writing log entries to segments
- Manages memory-mapped I/O for ultra-low latency writes
- Handles batch processing and accumulation
- Supports concurrent write operations

### 2. StorageSegment
- Represents a single log segment on disk
- Provides indexing and efficient lookup mechanisms
- Supports memory-mapped read/write operations
- Implements advanced caching strategies

### 3. BatchCoordinator
- Manages batch accumulation and backpressure
- Coordinates write operations across multiple segments
- Implements adaptive batching algorithms
- Ensures write consistency and performance

### 4. RecoveryManager
- Handles system recovery and crash scenarios
- Implements corruption detection mechanisms
- Provides truncation and repair strategies
- Supports point-in-time recovery
