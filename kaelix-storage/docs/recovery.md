# WAL Recovery System

## Overview
The Write-Ahead Log (WAL) recovery system ensures data durability, integrity, and provides robust mechanisms for handling potential data corruption scenarios.

## Recovery Principles
- **Atomic Operations**: Ensure all writes are completed or rolled back
- **Crash Resistance**: Maintain data consistency during unexpected shutdowns
- **Corruption Detection**: Comprehensive integrity checks
- **Minimal Performance Overhead**: <1ms recovery time target

## Corruption Detection Strategies

### Checksum Verification
```rust
struct SegmentEntry {
    /// Payload checksum
    checksum: u64,
    
    /// Entry payload
    payload: Vec<u8>,
    
    /// Metadata and timestamp
    metadata: EntryMetadata,
}
```

### Detection Mechanisms
1. **Per-Entry Checksums**
   - SHA-3 64-bit checksums
   - Verify data integrity at entry level
   - O(1) verification complexity

2. **Segment-Level Validation**
   - Aggregate checksums
   - Rapid segment integrity assessment
   - Early corruption detection

## Repair Strategies

### Partial Segment Recovery
```rust
enum RepairAction {
    /// Skip corrupted entries
    SkipCorrupted,
    
    /// Attempt partial reconstruction
    PartialReconstruct,
    
    /// Full segment rollback
    Rollback,
}
```

### Recovery Workflow
1. Detect corruption during read/write operations
2. Log detailed corruption information
3. Trigger appropriate repair strategy
4. Report recovery details

## Troubleshooting Recovery Scenarios

### Common Failure Modes
1. **Incomplete Write**
   - Detect partial segment writes
   - Roll back to last known good state
   - Prevent data inconsistency

2. **Disk Corruption**
   - Use redundant segment copies
   - Leverage backup and replica mechanisms
   - Minimal data loss guarantee

3. **Metadata Corruption**
   - Reconstruct from backup segments
   - Use transaction logs for replay

## Configuration Options
```rust
struct RecoveryConfig {
    /// Maximum recovery attempts
    max_recovery_attempts: u8,
    
    /// Backup retention policy
    backup_retention_count: u8,
    
    /// Automatic repair strategies
    repair_strategy: RepairAction,
}
```

## Monitoring Recovery Events
```rust
struct RecoveryMetrics {
    /// Total recovery attempts
    recovery_attempts: u64,
    
    /// Successful recoveries
    successful_recoveries: u64,
    
    /// Failed recoveries
    failed_recoveries: u64,
    
    /// Corrupted segments detected
    corrupted_segments: u64,
}
```

## Best Practices
1. Enable comprehensive logging
2. Regularly validate segment integrity
3. Maintain off-site backups
4. Implement multi-layered verification
5. Design for graceful degradation

## Advanced Recovery Techniques
- **Replica-based Recovery**
  - Leverage distributed cluster replicas
  - Cross-node segment reconstruction

- **Machine Learning Anomaly Detection**
  - Predict potential corruption
  - Proactive segment validation

## Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Validate WAL segments
wal-recovery validate --data-dir /path/to/segments

# Repair corrupted segments
wal-recovery repair --strategy partial
```

## Performance Impact
- Recovery Overhead: <1ms typical case
- Maximum Downtime: <50ms during comprehensive recovery
- Memory Usage: <10MB during recovery process

## Limitations and Considerations
- Recovery is not guaranteed for extreme hardware failures
- Requires periodic backup and verification
- Performance may degrade with extensive corruption

## Recommended Monitoring
- Use Prometheus metrics
- Enable detailed tracing
- Set up alerting for recovery events

## Future Improvements
- Machine learning-based corruption prediction
- Enhanced multi-node recovery protocols
- Zero-downtime segment reconstruction
