//! Segment-based storage management for efficient data organization
//!
//! Provides segment-based data organization, compaction, and garbage collection
//! for optimal storage efficiency and performance characteristics.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - **Segment Management**: Efficient creation, rotation, and cleanup of data segments
//! - **Compaction**: Background compaction to reduce storage overhead
//! - **Garbage Collection**: Automatic cleanup of expired and deleted messages
//! - **Index Management**: Segment-level indexing for fast message lookup
//! - **Compression**: Per-segment compression for reduced storage footprint
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The segment management system is organized around:
//!
//! - **Segment Manager**: High-level segment lifecycle management
//! - **Segment Writer**: Efficient writing to active segments
//! - **Segment Reader**: Optimized reading from segment files
//! - **Compaction Engine**: Background compaction and optimization
//! - **Index Manager**: Segment indexing for fast lookups
//!
//! ## Future Implementation (Task 14+)
//!
//! This module will be fully implemented in subsequent tasks as part of
//! the file-based storage backend implementation.
