## Development Methodology: Systematic Reconstruction Success

### Proven Approach (WAL Success Story)
The WAL implementation demonstrated the effectiveness of our systematic reconstruction methodology:

1. **Strategic Planning**: Comprehensive architecture design before implementation
2. **Component Isolation**: Building each component with clear boundaries
3. **Incremental Integration**: Step-by-step integration with existing systems
4. **Continuous Validation**: Testing at every stage of development
5. **Performance Focus**: Maintaining <10μs latency throughout development
6. **Documentation-Driven**: Creating documentation alongside implementation

### Key Success Factors
- **Zero-Warning Policy**: Maintaining clean compilation standards
- **Test-First Development**: Writing tests before implementation
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Continuous performance validation
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Technical and user documentation

### Session Continuity Framework
This CLAUDE.md serves as the continuity bridge between sessions, ensuring:
- **Complete Context**: Full awareness of project status and achievements
- **Clear Roadmap**: Next steps and remaining objectives
- **Technical History**: Implementation details and architectural decisions
- **Quality Standards**: Maintained development practices and requirements

## Rust Code Quality Guidelines

### Core Principles
1. **Zero-tolerance for warnings**: ALL cargo check warnings must be resolved
2. **Perfect formatting**: 100% cargo fmt compliance required
3. **Comprehensive testing**: 95%+ test coverage mandatory
4. **Performance-first**: Every component optimized for ultra-high performance
5. **Security-conscious**: Memory safety and security by design
6. **Documentation-complete**: 100% public API documentation coverage

## Quality Enforcement: Zero-Tolerance Framework

### Compilation Rules: Absolute Correctness
- **ZERO TOLERANCE** for compilation errors AND warnings
- ALL `cargo check --workspace` warnings must be treated as blocking errors
- ALL `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` warnings must be treated as blocking errors
- Developers MUST resolve ALL warnings before task completion
- Use `cargo check` instead of `cargo build` for enhanced developer experience
- No exceptions, no partial merges

```bash
# Enhanced zero-tolerance enforcement
cargo check --workspace          # Must pass with ZERO warnings
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings  # Must pass with ZERO warnings
cargo fmt --all --check         # Must pass with ZERO violations
cargo audit                     # Must pass with ZERO vulnerabilities
```

## Mandatory Testing Protocol: Completion-Driven Quality Gates

### Task Completion Testing Requirements
- **Code Changes**: Run `cargo check --workspace` and `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`
- **New Features**: Execute `cargo test --workspace` with coverage validation
- **Bug Fixes**: Run regression tests and affected module tests
- **Refactoring**: Execute full test suite to ensure no behavioral changes
- **Dependencies**: Run `cargo audit` for security vulnerability checks

### Quality Gate Enforcement
```bash
# MANDATORY commands at every completion:
cargo check --workspace                    # Zero warnings required
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings    # Zero violations required
cargo fmt --all --check                    # Perfect formatting required
cargo test --workspace                     # All tests must pass
cargo audit                                # Zero vulnerabilities required
```

## Automated Weekly Documentation Protocol

### Multi-Agent Documentation Workflow
1. **reader-agent**: Analyze all code changes, implementations, and technical achievements
2. **plan-agent**: Document strategic decisions, architectural choices, and rationale
3. **docs-agent**: Create comprehensive weekly summary documentation
4. **test-agent**: Validate quality metrics and compliance achievements
5. **security-agent**: Document security considerations and vulnerability assessments

### Weekly Summary Structure
```markdown
# Week [X] Summary: [Phase Name] - [Week Description]

## CI/CD Enforcement Mechanisms
- Automated checks on EVERY pull request
- Blocking merge conditions:
  1. Zero compilation warnings
  2. 100% formatting compliance
  3. All tests passing
  4. Performance benchmarks within defined thresholds

## Development Workflow Integration
- Update CLAUDE.md when updating the todo list and vice versa
- Maintain comprehensive documentation for all architectural decisions
- Follow multi-agent coordination patterns for complex tasks
- Ensure every completion meets mandatory testing requirements

## Global Rules for Code Generation
- When generating code involving external libraries, always invoke Context7 MCP server first
- Structure responses as: 1) Plan with Context7 data, 2) List assumptions, 3) Generate code, 4) Explain changes

## Important Instruction Reminders
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested
