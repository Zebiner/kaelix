# TODO.md - MemoryStreamer Development Tasks

## How to Use This File

1. **Check off tasks** as you complete them with `[x]`
2. **Use with Claude Code**: Copy relevant sections when asking for implementation help
3. **Track dependencies**: Tasks are ordered by dependency - complete earlier tasks first
4. **Reference CLAUDE.md**: For coding guidelines and project context
5. **Update regularly**: Add new discoveries and subtasks as needed
